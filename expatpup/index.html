Bringing your pet into the United Kingdom can seem daunting when you consider all the rules, regulations and costs involved.  While the process is costly and sometimes frustrating, itâ€™s not impossible.  If you tick all of the right boxes you and your pet will be able to enter the United Kingdom at the same time with absolutely no quarantine! <br><br>

If you happen to miss a step, your pet may be denied entry or put into quarantine for up to four months.
