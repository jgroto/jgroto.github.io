Properly presenting your pet's rabies vaccination information is crucial.  The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians provide a document on their website that is widely used by veterinarians and prompts all the information necessary to fulfill the UK government's guidelines.  Visit the NASPHV website at http://www.nasphv.org or download the document below.
