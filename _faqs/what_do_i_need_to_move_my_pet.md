<h1>What do I need to move my pet?</h1>

<h8> FAQs | Updated 05/01/2017 </h8>

<br>
Before you begin planning your pet’s journey, familiarize yourself with the steps required to bring your pet into the United Kingdom.  You may be surprised to realize that once you’ve purchased your flights and crate, your pet is only two vet visits away from being able to enter the United Kingdom without quarantine.

<br>
<h3>You will have to take the following steps to bring your pet into the United Kingdom:</h3>
<br>
<ul class="bold-list">
	<li>Approved microchip (placed prior to the rabies vaccination with implantation record)*</li>
	<li>Rabies vaccination and certificate</li>
	<li>Tapeworm treatment</li>
	<li>Third-country official veterinary certificate (Annex IV) endorsed by the USDA</li>
	<li>Declaration that you will not sell or transfer ownership of your pet</li>
	<li>Veterinary statement that your pet is fit to fly</li>
	<li>Your pet’s medical history</li>
	<li>Airline approved travel crate</li>
	<li>Airline ticket for you and your pet</li>
	<li>Paid clearance fees (usually included with your pet’s plane ticket)</li>
	<div class="subscript">
		*if you don’t have a certificate, have your vet write a statement including when your pet received their microchip, the make/model as well as the number.  If possible, obtain invoices from your vet’s office that includes the time of the microchipping, the rabies vaccine and the tapeworm treatment.  This will help corroborate the dates listed on your pet’s third-country official veterinary certificate. 
	</div>
</ul>

The difficulty arises not in what you have to do, but when you have to do it.  Even straightforward steps, such as buying your pet’s plane ticket, have time constraints and restrictions that may affect other steps in the process.
