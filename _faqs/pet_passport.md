In an effort to ease travel restrictions on pets travelling to and within the EU, the Pet Travel Scheme (PETS) was created.  Part of the PET scheme included the Pet Passport, a document with uniform information regarding your pet’s identity, ownership, and medical history.  While pets from non-EU countries are able to enter without quarantine if meeting the requirements, countries like the United States do not issue pet passports.  Instead, pets from the United States are required to have a third-country official veterinary certificate (Annex).  

If you plan to stay in the EU over four months with your pet, you will need to visit an EU veterinarian to obtain a Pet Passport.  

To obtain a Pet Passport in the EU you must:  

<b>-Have a completed and valid Annex certificate.</b>  The Annex should have been stamped upon entry to the EU.

<b>-Be up to date on all vaccinations including rabies.</b>  While blood tests for rabies are required for non-listed countries, pets from the United States are not required to have one.

<b>-Have a complete medical and vaccination history</b> to give to your EU veterinarian.

<b>-Have an ISO compatible microchip.</b>

All of the necessary requirements are covered under the entry requirements for the UK, so if you have retained your paperwork and it is within four months of the Annex being issued, you should have no issues obtaining one.  Most veterinarians in the United Kingdom can issue pet passports and they usually cost around £40.
