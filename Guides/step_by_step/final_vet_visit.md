The most important veterinary appointment is the last one.  This is where your dog will receive their tapeworm treatment, where your pet will be deemed fit to travel and where all your paperwork and documents will be completed.  The <a>PETS travel scheme</a> is fairly new and specific to the United Kingdom, so even seasoned vets may not be aware of all the rules.  Consider printing out the necessary forms in advance as well as bringing a <a href="/checklist">checklist</a> of everything that needs to be accomplished.  A printable <a href="/checklist">checklist</a> that you can keep with your paperwork can be found on the <a href="/checklist">Checklist page.</a>

<b>-Your dog must receive tapeworm treatment.</b>  This treatment must be approved for use in the United States as well as have praziquantel or an equivalent as its active ingredient.  If you are transporting a cat, they will not need a tapeworm treatment in order to be admitted into the United Kingdom.

<b>-An examination that your pet is fit to fly.</b>  When your veterinarian has deemed your pet okay to travel, they must write and sign a short statement on their letterhead.

<b>-Your vet must fill out the third-country official veterinary certificate (ANNEX IV).</b>  On this paperwork they must list the tapeworm treatment they’ve just administered under the “Echinococcus treatment” section and include the name and manufacturer of the product as well as the date and time.  They must also stamp the paperwork and sign their name. 

<b>-Obtain your pet’s rabies vaccination certificate.</b>  The certificate must include the pet’s microchip number as well as the product used, batch number and batch expiration date.  This also must be signed by your veterinarian.

<b>-Gather any paperwork regarding your pet’s microchipping.</b>  This can be an official implantation record or a statement from your veterinarian including when your pet received the microchip, the make/model as well as the number.  

<b>-Have your pet undergo any other treatment that is due.</b>  Your pet must be up to date on all vaccinations and immunizations before travel.  

<b>-Obtain your pet’s medical records.</b>  While only microchipping, rabies and tapeworm have specific rules, the UK government assumes that your pet is up to date on all other treatments.  This information will also be useful for your new veterinarian in the United Kingdom.

<b>-Obtain invoices or receipts that include dates of the microchipping, the rabies vaccination and the tapeworm treatment.</b>  While this is not necessary, any additional information that corroborates the dates listed on your paperwork will only be helpful to you if questions arise.

Before you leave the clinic, examine all of the paperwork.  Make sure that your vet has filled out all forms completely, that the ANNEX IV is signed and stamped and all of the dates and information is consistent across the paperwork.  This information will also be checked at the USDA office, but there may not be time to rectify any mistakes.

After your final veterinary visit, your paperwork is almost complete.  If you have not yet completed the <a href="">declaration form</a> that states you will not sell or transfer ownership of your pet, do so now.  Once that is finished, you have successfully obtained all paperwork needed for travel.  

Under the PETS scheme, all documentation must be original.  However, it’s a good idea to make copies for your own records as the originals will be surrendered at the airport when you drop your pet off at customs.  The paperwork will be returned to you when your pet has cleared customs in the United Kingdom.
