The bulk of the requirements for your pet’s shipping container come directly from the airlines.  While most specifications are similar, make sure you consult the documentation from your airline regarding any crate requirements.  If reading through the requirements sounds daunting, don’t worry!  Several companies make affordable kennels that meet all the requirements and they can be easily found.  

In order for your pet to travel, their crate must be IATA approved.  It also must meet the following specifications:

-The crate must be made of hard plastic.  Some airlines will allow wood or metal crates especially in the case of larger pets.

-The crate must be non-collapsible and front loading.  (You cannot have a door on the top of the container)

-Ventilation must be present around four sides of the container.  However, the sides must not be ventilated at both the top and bottom and you cannot have ventilation on the roof of the crate.

-The floor of the crate must be leak-proof.  Most airlines also require additional absorbent material to be placed in the bottom of the crate, such as newspapers or puppy floor training pads.  Check to see if your airline will allow a blanket or a comfort item, such as an old t-shirt with your smell, to ease your pet’s worries.

-The crate must be equipped with a water dish attached to the inside door of the kennel.  

-The top and bottom sections of the crate must be held together with screws, not clasps.  

-There must be a central locking mechanism on the door and the door must be made of metal.  The locking pins must go through the roof and floor at least 6mm.  It is absolutely important that your pet is secure in their cage for the entire time of travel.  If the airline allows you to ziptie the cage door, do so.  Some kennels come with holes that allow for easy zip tie insertion.  

-The crate must be large enough for your pet to stand up and turn around freely.  There must be at least 5cm free space above their head.  In addition to the length of your dog (nose to base of tail) you will also need additional space equal to their legs.  This is to ensure your dog can comfortably lay down with legs completely extended.    

-The crate must be labeled with a “live animal” sticker one inch in height on the top and the side of the container.  You must also have directional arrows showing which end of the crate is “up” on at least two sides of the container.  These may be provided at the airport or with the purchase of your kennel.  

-Some airlines require all fittings be made of steel.  Unfortunately, most kennels come with plastic, non corrosive, screws which means you will need to replace these on your own.  Further to the fittings, some airlines require that all connection points of the cage assembly be ziptied.  This is a good idea regardless of the requirements, as your pet’s safety relies on a solid crate.

-No wheels or front/rear handles allowed.  Additional handles compromise the sturdiness of the cage and the wheels make it possible for your pet’s cage to roll during transport.  

Some other things to consider:

-Most airlines do not allow toys, bones, bedding, medication or food during travel.  If the airline will allow it, you can include a drip-feed water bottle to ensure your pet is properly hydrated throughout the flight.  Most airlines suggest not feeding your dog two-four hours prior to take-off to limit the likelihood of an accident mid-flight.

-Consider writing your pet’s name and information in permanent marker or paint on the sides and top of the container.  Remember you will also need two “live animals” stickers as well as at least two directional arrows.  At US customs, paperwork will be placed in a waterproof covering and taped on the top of the container to later be retrieved by UK customs.

-Your pet’s journey will be even more stressful if they are not comfortable in a crate.  Consider purchasing your pet’s crate early on and enticing them inside with food, treats or toys.  

-If you have a heavy chewer, consider a crate with metal ventilation bars.  Holes within the plastic crate could be easily compromised by a determined dog.


The Petmate Sky Kennel and the Petmate Vari Kennel come heavily recommended by pet travel experts and adhere to most airline requirements.  They are manufactured with plastic fittings, however, so you will need to purchase steel screws if flying on an airline that requires it.
