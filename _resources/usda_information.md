One of the most confusing and easily missed steps of the pet immigration process is the necessity of a USDA endorsement on the Annex certificate.  This requirement is not found on the uk.gov website, but within the Annex paperwork itself.  On the bottom of the document there are three sections.  The official/authorized veterinarian (USDA accredited), the endorsement by the competent authority (the USDA) and the official at the traveller’s point of entry.  Both the veterinarian and the endorsement must be completed prior to travel and the official at the point of entry section will be completed upon entry into the United Kingdom.  

<h2>Do I need a USDA endorsement?</h2>

The short answer is yes.  Although the competent authority endorsement section states it’s unnecessary if the certificate is signed by an official veterinarian, a USDA accredited veterinarian is considered an authorized veterinarian not an official one, which means an endorsement by the competent authority (the USDA) is necessary.  Official veterinarians are those that are employed by the government and work directly for the USDA.  Some states do have USDA official veterinarians to assist in the animal exportation paperwork.  However, visiting an official veterinarian may require more effort than receiving an endorsement.  Official USDA veterinarians typically work within the same office as the USDA endorsement officials.  A USDA endorsement takes a matter of minutes and does not require your pet to be present.  An official veterinarian will have fewer appointments available and may not administer all required treatments.   

<h2>How do I get a USDA endorsement?</h2>

USDA office hours and procedures differ from state to state.  Some states require an advance appointment and some have no scheduling system.  All states have only one USDA office and if you live in a US territory, you’ll most likely be directed to the nearest state’s office.  You will be required to pay an endorsement fee which varies depending on the state, the type of animal you’re exporting, and where you’re travelling.  For a dog travelling to the UK, the fee will most likely be between $20 and $50.  Confirm beforehand whether the office accepts cash, card or checks, or be prepared to pay by any method.

Even if your USDA office does not have an appointment system, it is a good idea to call ahead of time to confirm office hours and openings.  Some offices have limited hours and are not open every weekday.  

Here's a list of USDA service centers in charge of endorsements:
