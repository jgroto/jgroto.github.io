There are a lot of stages to prepare your pet to travel without quarantine.  When we were preparing our own pet's journeys we kept a checklist to keep us on track with dates, documents and vaccines.   

<br>
This checklist includes all things necessary to move your pet from the US to the UK.  Use it as an organizational tool or to initiate conversations with your vet about what is necessary to bring your pet overseas.  It's also a good tool to double check your paperwork on the day of travel to insure you haven't misplaced a needed document.
