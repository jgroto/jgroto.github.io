	<p>Welcome to Ex-Pat Pup, a website dedicated to information for moving your pet easily and safely from the United States to the United Kingdom.  I began investigating how to successfully move a pet from the US to the UK in 2012 when I received a job offer from a London-based company.  My Jack Russell Terrier Roscoe has epilepsy and being 10 years old at the time, was not a young puppy any longer. 
<br /><br />
In an effort to circumvent flying a commercial airline I began researched pet transport companies.  I quickly realized that unless you have the money to book your pet on a private jet or commuter airplane, your pet will be flying in cargo on a commercial airline regardless of whether you use a travel service or not.  Once the realization set in that Roscoe would have to fly in cargo for this journey, I decided to forego using a third party and arrange his journey myself.
<br /><br />
For months I fretted over scary statistics, confusing paperwork and conflicting online information.  I was desperate to find an airline that had a dedicated team to handle pets and an outstanding record of animal safety.  I was also trying to make sense of the UK government website, revisiting time and again to confirm the necessary timeline and steps to avoid quarantine.
<br /><br />
At the time there weren’t a lot of websites with up to date travel information and while the UK.gov website outlined fairly clearly the steps needed to be taken, it didn’t provide all of the paperwork necessary.  I couldn’t find what a third-country travel form looked like, let alone how to get one and unfortunately our local Veterinarian had never completed one before.  I almost completely missed the step of having his paperwork approved by the USDA due to vague and somewhat confusing language.  Outside of paperwork, I also had difficulty purchasing a ticket, as some airlines were booked and others required carrier dimensions.
<br /><br />
From start to finish, it took us two months of researching, calling, driving and buying before Roscoe and I finally boarded our Virgin Airlines flight from New York City to London.  I nervously cried as I walked away from the Virgin Cargo desk at JFK, hoping that I had done everything right and that he would arrive safely on the other side.  After a little over 8 hours apart, I was reunited with a clean and happy boy who, all things considered, seem to fair better than I did on our overseas flight.
<br /><br />
Since our journey I’ve been approached by employers, friends and acquaintances about moving pets from the United States.  After years of forwarding the same large email time and again, I decided to organize all the information into a more easily read website.  I hope that expatpup.com helps people on their journey to bring their loved ones to the United Kingdom without facing high premiums or possible quarantine.  Roscoe and I made the journey on our own and you can too.</p>
