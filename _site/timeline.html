  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Due to specific time restrictions outlined by the UK government, the order and timeliness of the necessary steps are very important.  The simplest and most time consuming mistake regards the strict rules for rabies vaccinations.  If your pet requires a rabies vaccination before travelling, the soonest your pet can travel is 21 days after the vaccination date.  Know if your pet needs a rabies vaccination before booking any travel arrangements.</p>

<p>STEP 1 - Plan your flight</p>

<p>Booking travel with your pet has a lot more restrictions than booking a flight for a human companion.  Due to the restricted flights, seats and routes, I recommend booking your tickets at least two months in advance.  The more time you allow, the more likely you will book a flight on your desired carrier, in and out of your desired cities.  You’re also less likely to be affected by snags such as needing a new microchip, rabies vaccination or a delay in the arrival of your pet’s crate.</p>

<p>Some things to consider:</p>

<p>The UK restricts pet entry to specific pre-approved routes and companies.  Almost all approved airlines fly into Heathrow, but a few are allowed entry into Gatwick, Manchester, Glasgow and Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Not all non-stop flights from the United States will carry animals into the UK, even if they’re on the approved carrier list and flying to an approved arrival location.  You may need to travel with your pet to a specific departure city before boarding a flight to the UK.</p>

<p>Not all flights on approved routes allow pets.  This is important to remember because it can seriously alter your travel plans.  Some airlines only fly pets once a day or a couple times a week, meaning you may not be able to fly out on your preferred departure date.</p>

<p>There are only a few pet seats available per flight.  Once you’ve found an airline and a pet-friendly flight, you’ll need to book a seat.  While there may be 200 seats available for humans, there are only 5 or so available for pets.  These can fill up quickly during busy periods, or if one person on board has already booked several pets.</p>

<p>Some airlines require a human companion on board when your pet flies.  This is something I recommend regardless.  Your pet’s flight will be a stressful experience, even in the best of situations.  Having a familiar face during the handover period may ease your pet’s worries.</p>

<p>The pet transport location is not always convenient to the airport departures.  Your carrier may also require you to drop off your pet several hours in advance of your flight.  This is especially important if you need to take a connecting flight before your departure to the UK.</p>

<p>Choosing an airline</p>

<p>Your pet’s wellness and comfort depends greatly on this stage of planning.  If you are taking a regional flight to connect with your international one, you may be able to keep your pet in the cabin if they are small enough to fit underneath the seat.  However, on your international flight, your pet will not be with you in the main cabin, but within the cargo as required by the UK government.  Unfortunately, although the Department of Transportation requires airlines to submit animal injuries and fatalities in their Consumer Air Travel Report, there is no agency checking the submitted data is correct.  It is important to research up to date information about your specific carrier as the conditions of the cargo hold and the dedicated staff taking care of your pet vary from airline to airline.  While most cargo holds are pressurized, they’re not necessarily heated or cooled with the efficiency of the main cabin.  Only a few airlines, such as Virgin Atlantic, guarantee your pet will be in a temperature controlled environment with dedicated staff trained to handle animals.  The reality is, some airlines allow baggage handlers with no animal training to handle your pets and others fly planes that have less than optimal temperature environments in the hold.  Most accidents occur in the cargo during transport, although there have been several instances of animals being left on hot tarmacs or becoming loose from their cages due to handling negligence.  No one can guarantee a safe journey for either you or your pet, but choosing a shorter flight or an airline with a better safety record will greatly reduce the risks involved.</p>

<p>Most airlines book your pet’s travel based on their crate size, not their size or weight.  Each airline has their own crate requirements, listing specific ventilation or construction materials allowed.  There is also typically a “minimum size” crate, which may mean your small dog has a larger crate than technically needed, ultimately costing more money.  It’s a good idea to find a crate that is comfortable for your pet and abides by all of the travel guidelines before purchasing your tickets.</p>

<p>STEP 2 - Microchipping and Rabies Vaccination</p>

<p>Most likely your pet is up to date on their rabies vaccination and they may also already have a microchip.  However, the UK requires your pet to be microchipped before your pet is vaccinated for rabies.  The timing is crucial and there are several things the export and import authorities will check to confirm the events have taken place in order.  It is also important that your pet’s microchip is ISO compatible.  There are different microchip standards throughout the world and some popular brands have Euro and non-Euro lines available for purchase.  If your pet already has a microchip that is not compliant, they can be chipped again without the previous one being removed.  However, if you do need to have your pet microchipped again, remember they will need to be vaccinated for rabies afterward, even if they already have been vaccinated for rabies before.  If your pet requires a rabies vaccination to travel, it is important to remember that your pet cannot travel for 21 days after the rabies vaccination.  (the date of vaccination counts as 0, not 1)</p>

<p>Before your pet is cleared to travel, the export authorities will most likely:</p>

<p>-Scan your pet’s microchip.  If the microchip is unable to be read, if it’s not ISO compatible or if the date listed on the microchip is after the date listed on the rabies paperwork, your pet will not meet the requirements for travel.</p>

<p>-Check to see if your pet’s microchip number is listed on the rabies paperwork.  If you are re-vaccinating your dog before travel, make sure your vet lists this information on the documents.  If you have already met the necessary microchipping/vaccination requirements but this is not listed, have your vet notate and sign the rabies document when they are filling out the other paperwork required for your pet’s travel.</p>

<p>-Check that the dates on the third-country official veterinary certificate show the rabies vaccination came after the microchip.</p>

<p>STEP 3 - Make plans for your pet’s final vet visit and USDA endorsement</p>

<p>Once you have your pet’s microchip and rabies paperwork in order, it might be a good idea to schedule their final vet visit before your departure, especially if you have a particularly busy vet.  This visit must be between 24 hours to 5 days before departure and be completed by a USDA approved veterinarian.  Also note that once you have all of your travel documents filled out by your USDA vet, they must also be endorsed by a USDA official, which may be more difficult for some as most states only have one office with limited hours.  Knowing your USDA office hours and leaving one or two business days between your final vet visit and your flight will ensure you complete this final step before you travel.  Check to see if the USDA office you will be visiting offers or requires appointments, you may be able to schedule this ahead of time.</p>

<p>During your pet’s last veterinary trip before travel you will:</p>

<p>-have your vet fill out the third-country official veterinary certificate
-have your dog undergo a tapeworm treatment (not necessary for cats)
-have your vet write or sign a statement declaring your pet fit to fly (This step is not listed under the travel scheme, but is required by several airlines before travel.  Even if it’s not necessary for your flight, it’s fairly easy to acquire and is worth having.)
-obtain your pet’s medical records, especially any documents relating to their rabies vaccinations and microchipping.  Make sure your pet’s microchip information is listed on their rabies certification and your vet’s signature is present.
-if your pet is due for any other treatment or vaccination, it’s a good idea to undergo these before you travel.  While not specifically mandated by the PETS scheme, the UK government assumes your pet is up to date on their immunizations.</p>

<p>If you’ve visited multiple veterinarian clinics, make sure that your current veterinarian has all of your pet’s information on file.  If they’re missing information about your pet’s microchipping or do not have your pet’s rabies vaccination certificate, you may need to contact your previous veterinarian.</p>

<p>There is also a possibility that while your veterinarian is USDA approved, they have not been through the PETS scheme immigration process before.  If you have an opportunity before your final visit, speak with your veterinarian about the paperwork required.  They may want to research the rules prior to your visit or they may not have an ANNEX IV on file.  Research and planning will ensure the final days before travel run smoothly.</p>

<p>STEP 4 - Purchase your pet’s crate</p>

<p>The bulk of the requirements for your pet’s shipping container come directly from the airlines.  While most specifications are similar, make sure you consult the documentation from your airline regarding any crate requirements.</p>

<p>In order for your pet to travel, their crate must be IATA approved.  It also must meet the following specifications:</p>

<p>-The crate must be made of hard plastic.  Some airlines will allow wood or metal crates especially in the case of larger pets.
-The crate must be non-collapsible and front loading.  (You cannot have a door on the top of the container)
-Ventilation must be present around four sides of the container.  However, the sides must not be ventilated at both the top and bottom and you cannot have ventilation on the roof of the crate.
-The floor of the crate must be leak-proof.  Most airlines also require additional absorbent material to be placed in the bottom of the crate, such as newspapers or puppy floor training pads.  Check to see if your airline will allow a blanket or a comfort item, such as an old t-shirt with your smell, to ease your pet’s worries.
-The crate must be equipped with a water dish attached to the inside door of the kennel.<br />
-The top and bottom sections of the crate must be held together with screws, not clasps.<br />
-There must be a central locking mechanism on the door and the door must be made of metal.  The locking pins must go through the roof and floor at least 6mm.  It is absolutely important that your pet is secure in their cage for the entire time of travel.  If the airline allows you to ziptie the cage door, do so.  Some kennels come with holes that allow for easy zip tie insertion.<br />
-The crate must be large enough for your pet to stand up and turn around freely.  There must be at least 5cm free space above their head.  In addition to the length of your dog (nose to base of tail) you will also need additional space equal to their legs.  This is to ensure your dog can comfortably lay down with legs completely extended.  <br />
-The crate must be labeled with a “live animal” sticker one inch in height on the top and the side of the container.  You must also have directional arrows showing which end of the crate is “up” on at least two sides of the container.  These may be provided at the airport or with the purchase of your kennel.<br />
-Some airlines require all fittings be made of steel.  Unfortunately, most kennels come with plastic, non corrosive, screws which means you will need to replace these on your own.  Further to the fittings, some airlines require that all connection points of the cage assembly be ziptied.  This is a good idea regardless of the requirements, as your pet’s safety relies on a solid crate.
-No wheels or front/rear handles allowed.  Additional handles compromise the sturdiness of the cage and the wheels make it possible for your pet’s cage to roll during transport.</p>

<p>Some other things to consider:</p>

<p>-Most airlines do not allow toys, bones, bedding, medication or food during travel.  If the airline will allow it, you can include a drip-feed water bottle to ensure your pet is properly hydrated throughout the flight.  Most airlines suggest not feeding your dog two-four hours prior to take-off to limit the likelihood of an accident mid-flight.</p>

<p>-Consider writing your pet’s name and information in permanent marker or paint on the sides and top of the container.  Remember you will also need two “live animals” stickers as well as at least two directional arrows.  At US customs, paperwork will be placed in a waterproof covering and taped on the top of the container to later be retrieved by UK customs.</p>

<p>-Your pet’s journey will be even more stressful if they are not comfortable in a crate.  Consider purchasing your pet’s crate early on and enticing them inside with food, treats or toys.<br />
-If you have a heavy chewer, consider a crate with metal ventilation bars.  Holes within the plastic crate could be easily compromised by a determined dog.</p>

<p>The Petmate Sky Kennel and the Petmate Vari Kennel come heavily recommended by pet travel experts and adhere to most airline requirements.  They are manufactured with plastic fittings, however, so you will need to purchase steel screws if flying on an airline that requires it.  You can find metal fittings here: link to metal fittings.</p>

<p>STEP 5 - Final vet visit and paperwork</p>

<p>The most important veterinary appointment is the last one.  This is where your dog will receive their tapeworm treatment, where your pet will be deemed fit to travel and where all your paperwork and documents will be filled out and collected.  The PETS travel scheme is fairly new and specific to the United Kingdom, so even seasoned vets may not be aware of all the rules.  Consider printing out the necessary forms in advance as well as bringing a checklist of everything that needs to be accomplished.</p>

<p>-Your dog must receive tapeworm treatment.  This treatment must be approved for use in the United States as well as have praziquantel or an equivalent as its active ingredient.  If you are transporting a cat, they will not need a tapeworm treatment in order to be admitted into the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>-An examination that your pet is fit to fly.  When your veterinarian has deemed your pet okay to travel, they must write and sign a short statement on their letterhead.</p>

<p>-Your vet must fill out the third-country official veterinary certificate (ANNEX IV).  On this paperwork they must list the tapeworm treatment they’ve just administered under the “Echinococcus treatment” section and include the name and manufacturer of the product as well as the date and time.  They must also stamp the paperwork and sign their name.</p>

<p>-Obtain your pet’s rabies vaccination certificate.  The certificate must include the pet’s microchip number as well as the product used, batch number and batch expiration date.  This also must be signed by your veterinarian.</p>

<p>-Gather any paperwork regarding your pet’s microchipping.  This can be an official implantation record or a statement from your veterinarian including when your pet received the microchip, the make/model as well as the number.</p>

<p>-Have your pet undergo any other treatment that is due.  Your pet must be up to date on all vaccinations and immunizations before travel.</p>

<p>-Obtain your pet’s medical records.  While only microchipping, rabies and tapeworm have specific rules, the UK government assumes that your pet is up to date on all other treatments.  This information will also be useful for your new veterinarian in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>-Obtain invoices or receipts that include dates of the microchipping, the rabies vaccination and the tapeworm treatment.  While this is not necessary, any additional information that corroborates the dates listed on your paperwork will only be helpful to you if questions arise.</p>

<p>Before you leave the clinic, examine all of the paperwork.  Make sure that your vet has filled out all forms completely, that the ANNEX IV is signed and stamped and all of the dates and information is consistent across the paperwork.  This information will also be checked at the USDA office, but there may not be time to rectify any mistakes.</p>

<p>After your final veterinary visit, your paperwork is almost complete.  If you have not yet completed the declaration form that states you will not sell or transfer ownership of your pet, do so now.  Once that is finished, you have successfully obtained all paperwork needed for travel.</p>

<p>Under the PETS scheme, all documentation must be original.  However, it’s a good idea to make copies for your own records as the originals will be surrendered at the airport when you drop your pet off at customs.  The paperwork will be returned to you when your pet has cleared customs in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>STEP 6 - USDA endorsement</p>

<p>This is by far the most confusing and easily missed of all the steps required.  It can also be the most stressful considering you have at most five days before travel in order to complete the endorsement and most states only have one USDA office.  Because the paperwork must be original, faxing or emailing is not an option.  Although some offices accept paperwork by mail, the short time frame does not allow any time for errors.  Visiting the office in person will ensure that you’ve met all the requirements and that you have the endorsed paperwork in hand and ready for travel.  Consider making an appointment at your USDA office ahead of time as some centers do not allow walk-ins.  You will not need to bring your pet, only the completed paperwork required for travel.</p>

<p>If you are unable to visit the USDA office in person, call the office to learn the requirements for mail-in paperwork.  You will most likely be required to include payment for the processing fees as well as a self-addressed, pre-paid envelope for the return of your documents.</p>

<p>Most countries require the Federal government to review and endorse immigration paperwork as accurate and legitimate.  The USDA office will review the dates, ensure all documents are properly signed and that all necessary requirements to enter the destination country have been met.  You will most likely pay a fee for the endorsement which varies depending on the state.  There also may be restrictions on payment methods.  Bring cash, check and credit card or phone ahead for confirmation.</p>

<p>Once your paperwork is endorsed by the USDA, you’re ready for travel.  Congratulations!</p>
