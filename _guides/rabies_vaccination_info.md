The United Kingdom is considered rabies-free and because of that there are strict vaccination rules regarding pet travel.  While your pet may already be microchipped and have a rabies vaccination, there’s a chance these events took place in the wrong order.  The standards are also a bit different in Europe for microchips, so it is important to make sure your pet’s microchip is compatible and readable before you decide whether or not your pet needs a rabies vaccination.
<h3>The specific requirements regarding rabies vaccinations are as follows:</h3>

<b>-Your pet cannot travel for 21 days after the rabies vaccination.</b>  (the date of vaccination counts as 0, not 1)

<b>-Your pet’s microchip must have been placed prior to their rabies vaccination.</b>

<b>-Your pet’s microchip must be ISO compatible and readable.</b>  If not your pet will need a new microchip as well as a rabies vaccination after placement.  (even if they have been vaccinated for rabies prior to placement)

The timing is crucial and there are several things the export and import authorities will check to confirm the events have taken place in order.  
<h3>When your pet travels the authorities will most likely:</h3>

<b>-Scan your pet’s microchip.</b>  If the microchip is unable to be read, if it’s not ISO compatible or if the date listed on the microchip is after the date listed on the rabies paperwork, your pet will not meet the requirements for travel.  

<b>-Check to see if your pet’s microchip number is listed on the rabies paperwork.</b>  If you are re-vaccinating your dog before travel, make sure your vet lists this information on the documents.  If you have already met the necessary microchipping/vaccination requirements but the microchip information is not listed on the rabies certificate, have your vet notate and sign the rabies document when they are filling out the other paperwork required for your pet’s travel.  

<b>-Check that the dates on the third-country official veterinary certificate show the rabies vaccination came after the microchip.</b>

The type of documentation and rules regarding rabies and microchips varies from state to state and country to country.  Your veterinarian may be unfamiliar with the PETS travel scheme so it is very important that you understand the UK guidelines yourself and make sure that the right information is presented on your documents.  For example, some rabies certificates do not ask for microchip information, so your vet will have to notate the information on the certificate and sign the document.  Some widely used microchip brands have Euro and non-Euro compatible lines, so make sure your pet has a 15 digit ISO microchip that is required in all European countries.

While not required, it’s always a good idea to have a tag on your pet’s collar listing your phone number, microchip number and the name of the chip manufacturer.
