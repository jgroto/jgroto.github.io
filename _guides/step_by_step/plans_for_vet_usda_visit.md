Once you have your pet’s microchip and rabies paperwork in order, it might be a good idea to schedule their final vet visit before your departure, especially if you have a particularly busy vet.  This visit must be between 24 hours to 5 days before departure and be completed by a USDA approved veterinarian.  Also note that once you have all of your travel documents filled out by your USDA vet, they must also be endorsed by a USDA official, which may be more difficult for some as most states only have one office with limited hours.  Knowing your USDA office hours and leaving one or two business days between your final vet visit and your flight will ensure you complete this final step before you travel.  Check to see if the <a href="/usda">USDA office you will be visiting</a> offers or requires appointments, you may be able to schedule this ahead of time.  

<h3>During your pet’s last veterinary trip before travel you will:</h3>
<b>-have your vet fill out the third-country official veterinary certificate</b>

<b>-have your dog undergo a tapeworm treatment (not necessary for cats)</b>

<b>-have your vet write or sign a statement declaring your pet fit to fly.</b> (This step is not listed under the travel scheme, but is required by several airlines before travel.  Even if it’s not necessary for your flight, it’s fairly easy to acquire and is worth having.)

<b>-obtain your pet’s medical records,</b> especially any documents relating to their rabies vaccinations and microchipping.  Make sure your pet’s microchip information is listed on their rabies certification and your vet’s signature is present.

<b>-make sure your pet is up to date.</b>  If your pet is due for any other treatment or vaccination, it’s a good idea to undergo these before you travel.  While not specifically mandated by the PETS scheme, the UK government assumes your pet is up to date on their immunizations.

If you’ve visited multiple veterinarian clinics, make sure that your current veterinarian has all of your pet’s information on file.  If they’re missing information about your pet’s microchipping or do not have your pet’s rabies vaccination certificate, you may need to contact your previous veterinarian.  

There is also a possibility that while your veterinarian is USDA approved, they have not been through the PETS scheme immigration process before.  If you have an opportunity before your final visit, speak with your veterinarian about the paperwork required.  They may want to research the rules prior to your visit or they may not have an ANNEX IV on file.  Research and planning will ensure the final days before travel run smoothly.
