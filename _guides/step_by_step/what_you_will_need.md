Planning your pet’s journey is much easier once you familiarize yourself with the process.  You will have to take the following steps to bring your pet into the United Kingdom:

-approved microchip (placed prior to the rabies vaccination) with implantation record
-rabies vaccination and certificate
-tapeworm treatment
-third-country official veterinary certificate (Annex IV) endorsed by the USDA
-declaration that you will not sell or transfer ownership of your pet
-veterinary statement that your pet is fit to fly
-your pet’s medical history
-airline approved travel crate
-airline ticket for you and your pet
-paid clearance fees (usually included with your pet’s plane ticket)

*if you don’t have a certificate, have your vet write a statement including when your pet received their microchip, the make/model as well as the number.  If possible, obtain invoices from your vet’s office that includes the time of the microchipping, the rabies vaccine and the tapeworm treatment.  This will help corroborate the dates listed on your pet’s third-country official veterinary certificate. 

Now that you know what you need to do, you’ll need to know when to do it.  Read the timeline section to learn more about how to plan your pet’s journey.
