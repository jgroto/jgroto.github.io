Most likely your pet is up to date on their rabies vaccination and they may also already have a microchip.  However, the UK requires your pet to be microchipped <b>before</b> your pet is vaccinated for rabies.  The timing is crucial and there are several things the export and import authorities will check to confirm the events have taken place in order.  It is also important that your pet’s microchip is ISO compatible.  There are different microchip standards throughout the world and some popular brands have Euro and non-Euro lines available for purchase.  If your pet already has a microchip that is not compliant, they can be chipped again without the previous one being removed.  However, if you do need to have your pet microchipped again, remember they will need to be vaccinated for rabies afterward, even if they already have been vaccinated for rabies before.  If your pet requires a rabies vaccination to travel, it is important to remember that <b>your pet cannot travel for 21 days after the rabies vaccination.</b>  (the date of vaccination counts as 0, not 1)

<h3>Before your pet is cleared to travel, the export authorities will most likely:</h3>
<b>-Scan your pet’s microchip.</b>
If the microchip is unable to be read, if it’s not ISO compatible or if the date listed on the microchip is after the date listed on the rabies paperwork, your pet will not meet the requirements for travel.

<b>-Check to see if your pet’s microchip number is listed on the rabies paperwork.</b>
If you are re-vaccinating your dog before travel, make sure your vet lists this information on the documents.  If you have already met the necessary microchipping/vaccination requirements but this is not listed, have your vet notate and sign the rabies document when they are filling out the other paperwork required for your pet’s travel.

<b>-Check that the dates on the third-country official veterinary certificate show the rabies vaccination came after the microchip.</b>
If your pet has a compatible microchip and it was installed before your pet was vaccinated for rabies, you can skip this step.  This also changes your wait time from 21 days to 24 hours, the time restriction on your dog’s tapeworm treatment.  (cats do not need a tapeworm treatment)  In this time frame you will also need to visit a USDA office to have your paperwork endorsed, so plan accordingly.
