This is by far the most confusing and easily missed of all the steps required.  It can also be the most stressful considering you have at most five days before travel in order to complete the endorsement and most states only have one USDA office.  All paperwork must be completed and brought to the USDA office, they will not endorse incomplete paperwork.  The paperwork must also be original; faxing or emailing is not an option.  Although some offices accept paperwork by mail, the short time frame does not allow any time for errors.  Visiting the office in person will ensure that you’ve met all the requirements and that you have the endorsed paperwork in hand and ready for travel.  <b>Consider making an appointment at your USDA office ahead of time</b> as some centers do not allow walk-ins.  You will not need to bring your pet, only the completed paperwork required for travel.

If you are unable to visit the USDA office in person, call the office to learn the requirements for mail-in paperwork.  You will most likely be required to include payment for the processing fees as well as a self-addressed, pre-paid envelope for the return of your documents.  

Most countries require the Federal government to review and endorse immigration paperwork as accurate and legitimate.  The USDA office will review the dates, ensure all documents are properly signed and that all necessary requirements to enter the destination country have been met.  You will most likely pay a fee for the endorsement which varies depending on the state.  There also may be restrictions on payment methods.  Bring cash, check and credit card or phone ahead for confirmation.
